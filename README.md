Overview

This project explores the use of machine learning (ML) and data science (DS) techniques to develop a robust credit card fraud detection system. We utilize a variety of algorithms and approaches aimed at identifying fraudulent transactions in real-time.

Key Objectives

Preprocess and clean the raw credit card transaction dataset
Implement features engineering techniques to create informative features.
Train and evaluate various machine learning models to detect fraudulent transactions with high accuracy.
Explore approaches for dealing with the imbalanced nature of fraud datasets (significantly fewer fraudulent transactions).
Optimize model performance by using hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation.
(Optional) Deploy the best-performing model as a web service or API for real-time detection.
Dataset

Utilize a publicly available credit card fraud dataset (e.g., from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud ) or source your own data.
Describe the dataset characteristics (number of features, types of features, class distribution).
Technologies

Python
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
Matplotlib/Seaborn (for visualization)
(Optional) Flask or a similar framework (for web service deployment)
Algorithms

Start with a baseline model, such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest.
Experiment with other algorithms:
Decision Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Ensemble Methods (e.g., XGBoost)
(Optional) Consider unsupervised anomaly detection techniques.
Evaluation Metrics
